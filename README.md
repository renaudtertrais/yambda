# yambda [![npm package][npm-badge]][npm] [![Travis][travis-badge]][travis] [![Codecov][codecov-badge]][codecov]

*This is a work in progress, more functions and documentation will come soon.*

[Documentation](DOCS.md)

## Getting started

### Installation

```
$ npm install --save yambda
```

### Usage

Importing all the library:

```js
import y from 'yambda';

y.typeOf('foo');
```

Importing only one function :

```js
import typeOf from 'yambda/typeOf';

typeOf('foo');
```

## Motivations

I was very impressed by how Haskell was rendering complicated operations more simple, so I tried to implement Haskell's functions in javascript and this lead me to create this library.

The idea is also to enable functions such as `map()` or `reduce()` to be use on any value. So this mean to consider [any](DOCS.md#any) types as [functor](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#functor), [applicative](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#applicative-functor) or [monad](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#monad).

But the approach is different from libraries such as [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js). Instead of wrapping [native](DOCS.md#native) types inside objects with extra methods, **yambda** can take (depending on the function) [any](DOCS.md#any) types. The problem with wrapping is that you need 3 step to do a simple operation:

```js
import { Map } from 'immutable';
import map from 'yambda/map';

const inc = (x) => x + 1;
const obj = { foo: 1, bar: 2 };

const res = Map(obj).map(inc).toJS(); // { foo: 2, bar: 3 }

// with yambda
const res2 = map(inc, obj); // { foo: 2, bar: 3 }
```

**yambda** try also to be compatible with any libraries. When functions accept [any](DOCS.md#any) types, it will try to use the object method first. So this mean that if you are working with [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js), you can also do:

```js
import { Map } from 'immutable';
import map from 'yambda/map';

const inc = (x) => x + 1;
const obj = { foo: 1, bar: 2 };

const myMap = Map(obj);
const res = map(inc, myMap); // Map({ foo: 2, bar: 3 })
```

### Functional

**yambda** only exposes functions. The goal is to [compose](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#function-composition) or manipulate those functions in order to create new ones. **yambda**'s functions's arguments have a specific order: the function's subject or taget is always (when it makes sens) the last one in order to facilitate [composition](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#function-composition):

```js
import map from 'yambda/map';

map(fn, subject);
```

### Pure and Immutable

All functions of **yambda** are [pure](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#purity) and immutable.

### Curring and arity

All functions of **yambda** are [curried](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#currying) by default. Each function in the curry chain does not has not a fixed [arity](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#arity) *(may change in the futur)*. For mor information, see this [example](DOCS.md#examples) on the [curry](DOCS.md#curryfn) function.

## Inspiration

Thanks to those projects, I learnt a lot and they gave me the desire to create this library.
